   * want a simple, yet powerful, persistence engine that can be
     quickly integrated into your application, and is a breeze to
     debug.

 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Description: Package building tools for Debian
 This package contains the tools (including dpkg-source) required to
 unpack, build and upload Debian source packages.
 .
 `cpio' and `patch' are also required to manipulate source packages.
 Some older cpios are insufficient - use at least 2.4.2-2.
 .
 Most Debian source packages will require additional tools to build -
 for example, most packages need the `make' and the C compiler `gcc'.

Description: Enhanced access method for dselect
 dpkg-mountable adds an access method called `mountable' to dselect's list,
 which allows you to install of any filesystem specified in /etc/fstab (eg a
 normal hard disk partition, or an NFS server), which it will automatically
 mount and umount for you if necessary.
 .
 It also has some extra features not found in the standard dselect methods,
 such as provision for a local file tree (either parallel to the main
 distribution or totally separate), and only getting packages which are
 required, rather than the time-consuming recursive directory scan, as well as
 logging of all dpkg actions in the install method.

 Features you will find in Elm ME+ include: anonymous
 remailer support, chaining, PGP, MIME, MIME type guessing,
 message/rfc822 enhanced support, application/pgp support,
 fully configurable from within the program, delivery status
 notification (in compliance with ESMTP), and more.
 .
 PGP features include: mark on folder menu showing PGP
 encrypted messages and public key blocks, encryption and
 signing of outgoing messages, decryption, signature checking,
 mailing public key blocks, extracting public key blocks
 from messages.  Special feature allows you to have Elm ME+
 keep track of your PGP passphrase so you only need to enter
 it a minimal number of times.
 .
 MIME features include: internal handling of MIME encodings
 and multipart/* messages -- only needs to use metamail
 with a content-type that Elm doesn't understand, access
 to individual portions of MIME multipart message via
 a special menu, "[include" construct when editing message
 as well as a new easy-to-use "Attachments" menu that lets
 you add/modify/delete attachments, mime.types support.
 .
 Elm's interface is interactive, full-screen.  All configuration
 can be done within the program -- no need to edit external files.
 .
 This version of Elm ME+ is officially designated
 "Elm2.4ME+ PL43 (25)" meaning this enhanced version of
 Elm is based upon Elm2.4pl25.  Thus is has all features
 present in Elm2.4pl25 plus its enhanced feature set.

Description: A fast lexical analyzer generator.
 flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognized lexical
 patterns in text. flex reads the given input files for a description of a
 scanner to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of regular
 expressions and C code, called rules. flex generates as output a C source
 file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine yylex().  This file is compiled
 and linked with the -lfl library to produce an executable. When the
 executable is run, it analyzes its input for occurrences of the regular
 expressions. Whenever it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.

 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the Posix 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

 PCMCIA cards are commonly used in laptops to provide expanded
 capabilities, such as modems, increased memory, etc.  Some desktop PCs
 can accept PCMCIA cards as well, although this is rare.
 .
 Card Services for Linux is a complete PCMCIA support package.  It
 includes a set of client drivers for specific cards, and a card
 manager daemon that can respond to card insertion and removal events,
 loading and unloading drivers on demand.  It supports ``hot swapping''
 of PCMCIA cards, so cards can be inserted and ejected at any time.
 .
 The actual kernel modules required for this package are contained in
 the pcmcia-modules-<kernel version> package, where <kernel version> is
 the version of the kernel for which the modules have been compiled.

 of things not supported).  Work is currently underway to make it fully
 compatible with both POSIX and AT&T ksh (when the two don't conflict).
 .
 Since pdksh is free and compiles and runs on most common unix systems, it
 is very useful in creating a consistent user interface across multiple
 machines.  For example, in the CS dept. of MUN, pdksh is installed on a
 variety of machines including Suns, HPs, DecStations, pcs running Linux,
 etc., and is the login shell of ~4500 users.

 about the resources used by that program, collected by the system while
 the program was running.  You can select which information is reported
 and the format in which it is shown, or have `time' save the information
 in a file instead of display it on the screen.
 .
 The resources that `time' can report on fall into the general
 categories of time, memory, I/O, and IPC calls.
 .
 The GNU version can format the output in arbitrary ways by using a
 printf-style format string to include various resource measurements.

Description: X Window System (XFree86) infrastructure
 xfree86-common contains the filesystem infrastructure required for further
 installation of the X Window System in any configuration.
 .
 Those wishing an X server only (with remote font services and clients) will
 also require the xserver-common package and an X server package.
 .
 The counterpart to the above configuration is a machine with the X libraries
 (the xlib6g package), xbase-clients, a window manager, some X font packages,
 and likely many more client packages.
 .
 Those who desire a standalone X workstation (and/or are fuzzy on the concepts
 of X servers and X clients) will require both of the above sets of packages.
 A recommended minimal list of packages for such a configuration is:
 xbase-clients, xf86setup, xfonts-100dpi or xfonts-75dpi, xfonts-base,
 xfonts-scalable, xlib6g, xserver-common, an xserver (several are available,
 and which you use is largely dependent on your graphics hardware), a window
 manager (several are available, and which you use is largely a matter of
 preference), and a terminal emulator X client package (again, several are
 available and which you use is your decision).
 .
 A number of terms are used to refer to the X Window System, including "X", "X
 Version 11", "X11", "X11R6", and "X11R6.3".  The version of X used in Debian
 is derived from the version released by the XFree86 Project, Inc., and is
 thus often also referred to as "XFree86".  All of the preceding quoted terms
 are functionally interchangeable in a Debian system.
 .
 Still confused?  Install this package and then read the files in
 /usr/doc/xfree86-common/ for assistance.

Description: shared libraries required by X clients
 The X libraries are the interface between X client programs and the
 hardware-oriented X servers, and consist of routines to read input from the
 keyboard and pointer, draw on the screen, etc., in an abstract manner that is
 independent of the particular characteristics of the hardware.  The X
 libraries communicate with X servers by means of the X protocol.  Xlib itself
 provides the low-level functionality; Xt, the X Toolkit Intrinsics, is often
 used as a foundation for widget libraries such as Lesstif or Athena.  Xaw,
 the Athena widget set, provides a rudimentary set of graphical user-interface
 elements (buttons, scrollbars, text boxes, etc.).  Several more libraries are
 provided to implement the functions of various X extensions.
 .
 xlib6g also contains the XKB specification files, locale data, and the bitmap
 image files that ship with X11R6.3.
